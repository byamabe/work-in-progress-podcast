        <p class= "speaker-1"><span>Todd Wilken [TW]: </span>Something about this age of progressivism. We live here in 21st
    century America. I noticed that while the progress used to be considered plodding, we're gonna be careful and deliberate. We're gonna move forward and move society
    forward in a considered and a very careful way, maybe even cautious progressivism of the past. All of that has gone out the
    window. Progressivism today has simply taken the break off the off the train and decided to stoke the fire and go as
    fast down the track as it possibly can make as much headway in as little time as possible. The rate of progress, so
    to speak in modern progressivism, is frankly alarming. And it's a challenge to those who are trying to raise Christian
    Children in a nation that is well living in its age of progressivism. Welcome back to issues, et cetera. We're
    coming to you live from the fifth annual issues that cetera making the case conference at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in
    Collinsville, Illinois. I'm Todd Wilkin. Thanks for tuning us in. We're talking about raising Children in an age of
    progressivism. Pastor Jonathan Fisk will be our guest, and you can join us as well. Our email address talkback at
    issuesetc.org, our Twitter address at issues E.T.C. and for those who want to do so, if time permits will open up
    the audience mic for questions as well as we broadcast from the Issues, Etc. Making the Case Conference here in
    Collinsville, joining us to talk about raising Christian Children and age of progressivism. Pastor Jonathan Fisk
    he's host of Worldview Everlasting TV Live. He's a creative consultant to WEtv, producer of the theological storytelling
    podcast. This is hard to pronounce Rev. Fisk Raw. I'll let you pronounce it. And he's author of the book "Broken –
    Seven Christian Rules Every Christian Ought to Break as often as Possible." Jonathan, welcome back.
        </p>

  <p class="speaker-2"> <span>Jonathan Fisk[JF]: </span>Yeah, thanks for having me. Hello everybody.</p class= "speaker-2">

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>How do you want to respond to somebody who says, "Look, this is no different than
    in the other age that Christians have found themselves in. Every generation of Christians have thought that they're living in the decline of
    something. They all have thought that they're living in the worst of times." How do you respond to that?
  </p>

  <p class= "speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>Well, I agree with them to some extent in that there's there's a total element of
    truth in that. If there's anything I think I've learned from history is that almost everyone in history thought they were looking at the end
    of the world, and they made grandiose claims about that. And if you listen to today, you hear that as well, not only from
    Christian groups but the populism movements of the last election, the the futurist movements of the singularity movement.
    People think we're gonna join with human or join with computers and reach everlasting life. That everyone believes we're at
    the fullness of history and that's nothing new. So yes, there is that. But in terms of the rise and fall of
    civilizations, this is also a pattern you can trace throughout history and so just cause the world… just because you're
    civilizations ending doesn't mean the world is ending and just cause the world not any doesn't mean your civilization isn't
    ending. And I would say then I think we might just be near the end of whatever this civilization was. That doesn't mean that
    it's gonna end in a cataclysm, necessarily. But it does mean that the cultural norms which we expected to be the the
    assumptions of our world view they are being under minded, they are falling apart. And whereas Christianity at one
    point was in line with that, at least kind of morally speaking, 10 Commandments… count the last four maybe the last
    six. Not the 1st 4 So much speaking. I guess, fourth commandment, maybe, but point being, we used to be in line with the
    culture and that as this drift is happening and as the culture is descending into, - you made me think it in your
    introduction there. - God catching the proud in the imagination of their hearts, and kind of trapping them in their own sin as it
    happens that this division between those who would be Christian and what they see in the world around them is just
    widening and widening at a, I'll say, a compounding rate to go with your picking up of speed. Compounding is a
    monetary idea that when you put interest into something and you let that interest stay there, whatever you're
    getting interest in the bank, that interest is now gaining interest and at first, it's very small, but you let that go for a lifetime
    and suddenly it begins to curve upward at a great, exponential rate. And that seems to be what the progressive thinking
    is doing at this point to the culture.
  </p class="speaker-2">

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>So how would you define progressivism?
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>I have no idea. Insanity? At this point.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>Let's let's do it this way. What makes progressivism different from progress?
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>Oh, that's good. Because progressivism is an ideology. It is a belief in a future that it's trying
    to attain by a certain kind of means. And to some extent, it least it used to be, I think, that means was or that idea was progress
    alone. So the progress is toward more progress. I'm not sure it's doing that anymore. I think we actually have some
    more solid things. Like, uh, I don't know. Whatever the transgender movement the homosexual movement has really latched
    onto is more than just change now for change's sake. There's something more, I think, diabolical at root. Not that just
    homosexuality is diabolical, but that there is an anti-truth going on that is really deep. But so defining that
    change within progressivism itself. And you've seen this a little bit as this past two years. There are individuals at one
    point were even leaders in a pro-homosexual movement, homosexual rights movement who have been ostracised and kicked
    out of that movement and treated quite violently. If you consider Twitter to be violence because they have not jumped on
    the transgender movement, so they're eating their own in a certain way. And why is that? Because it's not again. It's
    not just about change at this point. So the difference between that and say progress, at least in theory progress is a
    word means to improve something to move toward a better thing. And certainly if you're in a bad place, you want to
    progress toward a good place. But if you're a good place, you don't want progress toward a bad place. So that's why you can't
    turn it into an ideology to serve a religion in and of itself. You know you're opening question, though there with
    with, you know, how do I define progressivism today? Because I do use the word a lot, and I I don't know, and I want to.
    What is at root, what is driving them? And I would just fall back on sort of what what broken talks about at length is
    this idea of romanticism that was a reaction against modernism that is modernism trumpeted the mind of mankind is the
    answer to all our problems, and it led to World War I, that's painting with a very broad brush. But it is effectively what
    happened historically and then artistically. And at that point, the arts and science flipped in the other direction
    and begin to promote emotion as the centre demands truth. And as we've chased that rabbit harder and harder and harder.
    We now are at a place where people people don't think, they feel, and that continues to be sort of at the bottom of
    this. So why is the transgender individuals so convinced that you hate them, is because their feelings about this are so
    strong. They're not able normally, to have a logical argument or discussion about why you think God created the world,
    sent His Son to die for the world, has a design for creation. They can't get that far to think. Oh, there's a
    rational reason for this. All they feel is the pain. Ah, and so that somehow that's at the root of what progressivism really
    is now. I'd go one more and add to it. There's this thing called self-justification that we all are born with. And, ah,
    the progressive movement is trapped in a need to justify its ideology is movement forward and it can't stop the train
    now that it's going this fast.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>Okay, so let's talk about that speed of progress. And I've often wondered whether it's just me
    getting older and as you get older, time goes by quicker and you catch less of what's passing by and ask my wife how much I miss in the
    course of ordinary day or just a single conversation. And part of it is just me being me, and part of it is as one
    grows older the world does seem to just… time speeds up. When you were a child, a week seemed like a year, and now the
    years seemed like weeks, and that's that's how it it seems. But I don't think that's just Wilkin getting older. I think
    the speed of whether it's a social or the political agenda, whatever it may be, is breakneck. I can't keep up with it,
    and then the minute you think they'll never go that far, they already have a week late. You know, you read about it.
    What is what's driving that kind? No society can sustain itself with that kind of rapid change.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>That kind of change, no, not at all. What's driving it is the Internet not as a ideology, but as a
    technology. And it's allowed us to do things that are really phenomenal. But as a result, so what's speeding up is not the Internet,
    what's speeding up is information. Information is coming faster and faster and faster and crossing borders in ways
    that it never did before. So that somebody… an event that took place in in China today, could affect the stock market
    today, right and maybe even faster than you could get there to deal with it. Yet there are computers that are watching this
    and making hyper-micro investments that are buying and selling faster than you can read that are gonna profit on that
    kind of a thing, right? So that's just one edge of where the information is just moving so quick, and those who have the
    power of the PC or the Mac, or the understanding, really can can manipulate that. So with that, then you have the
    hyperdrive of entertainment to the point that we're now… there is so much… you could just pick whatever favorite
    medium you want. It doesn't have to be… YouTube would be its own medium. Movies would be its own medium. One channel on
    cable would be its own medium. And because you're a human being, you could not possibly watch everything they're going to
    be producing. It's just impossible. They have more coming out then we, as individuals, can possibly take in. So
    increasingly we're having to decide. What am I listening to? What am I gonna pay attention to as it flies past you,
    right? And as that's happening, then you have to you get siloed into self-selective understanding. So I'm gonna pick
    the things that tell me that I'm right, right, because that what we do. We self-justify constantly. And so we start
    increasingly moving into what we call a safe space. I suppose for our mental thinking or our a worldview. But the
    rest of the world is all that information, and you have other people that are there. They think they're getting into a
    safe space, but they're changing so fast that they're unrecognizable from what you are or how you think. So, the pieces
    that link this together and I can't… I don't have a doctorate in this. I'm no expert on it. I'm just kind of watching it
    and trying to keep my finger on it as best I can for my own head. The pieces are moving so fast, the technology is
    increasing, doubling its… not size but in its smallness and ability to do more every single year that the
    information is outpacing us and our ability to absorb or understand it. And this is where the segue into, how do I teach my
    children to live in this world, really becomes imperative. Especially if you're people who believe that the Word who became
    flesh is well, he's not just information, but His means of grace is information at this point lives in the realm of the
    knowledge of God. How do I segregate that information that word from the rest of it, while still remembering they have to live
    in this world. We can't go live in caves. We can't actually, we'd all die if we tried. I think at this point

    <span>TW: </span>Pastor Jonathan Fisk is our guest. We're broadcasting live from the Issues, Etc. Making the Case
    Conference at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Collinsville, Illinois, on this Friday, June the ninth. Talking about Raising Christian
    Children In an age of progressivism. When we come back, we're gonna talk about well, progress, used to have goals. Kind
    of concrete goals. Let's build our own highway through this country. What are the goals of progressivism?
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>We're talking about raising Children in an age of progressivism. Pastor Jonathan Fisk is our guest.
    Jonathan, the goals of old school. Let's talk about Christian Progressivism or Christian Progress. Was sick people need help.
    Let's build a hospital. We have hospitals because Christians thought them up. People need to be educated. Let's build a
    school or a university. They've all been taken over by progressives now. They had goals that were oriented, it seems,
    toward serving the neighbor. What are the goals or the orientation of the goals of progressivism?
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>Yeah, it seems like that is really kind of changed in its direction. And you said to me in the
    break. You know, where are the hospitals that they're building now? I think there are some and I don't want to throw the current era
    under the bus entirely in that they're sort of seems to be this this drive for charity or at least giving money to
    large charitable organizations, or organizations that purport to be doing charity, which still plays on a lot of
    progressives. But what are they actually trying to build? What is actually working toward? What is the future that they hope to
    see? It is certainly not the American dream. It gets a little. It's one of those places in life where I am personally,
    really tempted by conspiracy theories. I try to avoid them as often as possible because you just go crazy. But the idea
    that the radical ideology of the present really has the destruction of Western civilization in a Marxist mindset at root
    that is that in order for the workers' paradise to arise, the current capitalist destructive place has to collapse. And
    from the ashes we will build the workers' paradise. You start to wonder if that isn't really part of what's going on
    behind it all. You also got to give the devil a little bit of credit. He is the prince of this age, and he's pulling
    strings that we don't even know exist in terms of the movement of powers and principalities and all that kind of stuff. So
    to get down and ask, what does does the moving itself actually have an agenda at this point, besides eating itself to
    death? I don't know that I could pinpoint that, I think, and this is maybe part of the hyper individualization of
    what's going on as well. They're back in the age of the Christian progress you are building toward it was wrong, but they
    called the Kingdom of God. I mean, they thought we were gonna build the Kingdom of God on Earth. So you're building
    toward a community, right? Whereas now we, the individuals far surpassed the community. What I want is really what's
    important? What you want. I don't care. We love each other until you're my way and they get out of my way right kind
    of thing. And is this the way that that our mindset has approached almost everything so that to answer the question,
    What is the ideology that's driving us? There isn't one, but each individual is hyper driven by something that is unique
    to them, even to the point where they're striving to be… to have a unique purpose just unto themselves. I'm gonna give
    one example. There's a wonderful book I've recommended before called “The Narcissism Narcissism Epidemic” by Jean
    Twenge. And it talks about how the under 40 under 30 generation kind of has on the on the classic psychological narcissism
    scale. We're up a couple of ticks, right? So back in the day, everybody would end up like somewhere around four or
    five, which is kind of healthy. And now just about every one of my generation's ends up more like a seven and you get to
    10 and you're you're dealing with like megalomaniacal personalities that don't care about anybody else, right? And
    we've moved up in that direction. One of the examples they gave, which just cut me to the heart, was it talked about the
    rise in unique names for Children and how there is a disassociation with the names of the past that is, the community of
    our fathers. We used to name your kid after yourself, after father, your grandma or whatever, and an attempt to name
    your kid something that they alone will have. And I'm case number one for that. I won't say my kids' names right now, but
    I tell you, every single kid along the way, we try to name uniquely and we were so frustrated when the second one we
    named, we thought it was really unique, and found out it was the second most popular name in her generation. Ah, you
    gotta be kidding me, right? So this this hyper-individual, that's all to share the hyper-individualization. What is
    the ideology is whatever I happen to say it is. And then if you can sway enough people with emotion to get into a group,
    thinking you agree with them and it really doesn't matter if you do. They just had to be convinced that you agree
    with them. This is the beauty of Trump and Sanders on both sides. There are people convinced they agree with them, but we
    don't actually know what they're teaching or saying. Then you can move a movement so you get back to Nietzsche's
    strongman. Right? the will of power, the guy who can get the bundle of sticks to move in the same direction. He
    doesn't care about the sticks if he breaks a few as long as you all get in the same direction. But then you can't break the
    bundle of sticks. That's fascism, by definition.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. Now you're talking about fascism. I want to come back to that.
    Let's stay in the in the hearth and the home. You had mentioned that one book on narcissism, Another book. I mentioned this because
    Terry Mattingly just tweeted this daring me to mention it. Rod Dreher has written, he's a regular guest on the program
    from the American conservative, and he's and he's written the book “The Benedict Option.” He's actually gonna be
    presenting the Benedict Option, our next conference in November down in Houston, Texas. And, uh, he is talking to Christians
    and to the church in general, especially in America, about thinking about living without all of the benefits that have
    accrued to us as citizens in this country. They may be taken away from us or withheld from us, or perhaps even just no
    longer be available to everybody precisely because we are Christians. He's telling people that the future for raising Children
    in this, this America, as it looks today, is going to get a lot harder before it ever gets any easier. What are your thoughts?
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>Yeah, I mean, I agree with him, and I think that there's… without having read the book at all,
    right? I have no idea. But I know Benedict and I know the monastery and know the rule of Benedict, which wasn't quite the Carthusian
    disaster that the late Middle Ages had. Whether or not we intentionally begin to choose to ghetto ourselves or whether
    or not they're going to do it to us I think we need to be prepared mentally for it. I think it's coming one way or
    the other. And if you're smart, you build your own ghetto before someone puts you in one they built for you. And again,
    what do you look at the cultures… the subcultures that are currently dying in the United States, of which Lutheranism is
    one, and we need to acknowledge that, there are a few that are not. And one of the most shocking is the Amish. The Amish
    are expanding and buying land because there's so many of them. They can't stay on the land they had since the 1800's.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>Plus, they're having kids, too.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>Well, that kinda has something to do with it, But it's it's half of it because the other half is
    they're not just having kids. They're keeping kids. We Lutherans, we haven't had kids. We haven't kept kids. We've lost on both ends,
    and maybe there's something of that that goes together. I don't have any research to back that up. I have a hunch on it.
    But I mean, you know, the Amish, they have this thing where they go out, I forget what they call it. They go out at a
    certain age and experience the world for a year. You would think they would all stay if it's so great out here, they
    don't. They go back, they stay with their families. And so, you know, kind of transitioning now, at least for my mind
    toward family… toward hearth a little bit. Probably the most radical thing we're doing in our home is we are instilling
    in our children the knowledge that we desire them to live close to us, if at all possible for the rest of their
    lives, preferably on the same block. Now they're over there somewhere, right? So you know, I don't want to embarrass them
    too much. Um, I am trying to instill that idea in them in the full knowledge that the odds are just dead against me. It
    just is so unlikely is gonna happen so my wife and I talked about getting a motor home and retirement instead of a house,
    right? So we go visit them, all that. But what this gets toward the Benedict option idea, which is that we're
    thinking for our… for the sake of their faith. This isn't so we can have barbecues, I like barbecues, too. But that's not why
    we're doing this. It's for the sake of their faith, for the sake of retaining a community in which we're holding the
    same worldview. We are trying to plant the seed that the best option is a small community that is intimately connected
    to each other and that shares things in common and maybe even shares land or extended housing or however you want to
    organize it. Now, to convince your average Christian in the pew do this not just with their family, but to even
    think about this as a congregation is, well, we're in. We're fish in water, and the topic we're talking about that's so
    dangerous is the water. And how do you get the fish to recognize the water? That's where I felt as a parish pastor I
    would pull my hair out the most. It's just like we don't even see that were drowning. You think back to the start of
    the Missouri Synod, where some guy who happen to be half a cult leader at least but still was able to convince three
    ships full of people to sell everything they owned, travel across the planet and plant a colony for the sake of what,
    historically, at least, was the right to not have the Lord's Supper from a Calvinist hand. I don't think I could
    convince you to do that for anything.
  </p>

  <p class= "speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>You can't get people to show up for a regular communion service, much less travel across the world.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>Right! And so I'm curious. You know, what the benefit option proposes, but I'm doubly curious how
    on earth it would propose we go about waking up the minds of the blissfully ignorant at the moment. The frog in the pot.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>Okay, so you've talked briefly there for a moment about kind of your long term goals raising
    Christian Children for this. As you said, for the sake of the faith, talking to them about, “you know, you don't have to move away. You
    don't even have to move that far away.” Which is not that far back in our history, at a common experience in at least rural
    America, where people would… they might be a section over, they might be 1/2 mile down the road, but they were still
    within, if not shouting distance. They were within a very short walk of one another. That was simple economic
    necessity, wasn't it? So how do we big turn our minds back as parents? For some of us, it might be too late. But turn our minds
    back as parents to say, OK, I need to think more like my ancestors than I might be comfortable with.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>l, as a young man, I think it was partially economic necessity that made me start thinking this
    way. I mean, I didn't hear the term education bubble until about two and 1/2 years ago, but I kind of had the feeling for about six
    or seven years before that, college education might not always be what you need, and it might just be a pyramid scheme.
    Now, I think that for certain courses of life, certain vocations, you definitely wanna have what a college education
    can give you. But this idea that I grew up with which was that Well, you're gonna go to college. Everyone goes college.
    You don't go to college you can't get a good job. Not only is that just blatantly untrue, most of the mega companies of
    today were built by guys that dropped out of college or founded the company in college and graduated and stay with
    the company kind of thing. But on top of that, it's a pocketbook issue that I simply with five Children, there's no way
    I'm taking out enough loans to get those four kids, five kids through college. There's just not a chance of that. Yeah,
    well after… well, I can tell you about our plans. We got other ideas. There's other ways. There's counterintuitive, slow
    steps you can take to try to make sure kids still get educated because we definitely want that. But the pocketbook
    is where this kind of came out. So it was. It was me realizing, Look, I will not be able to financially do this. What
    are the other options that made me really step back and start thinking about that, that entire picture. And so to some
    extent, this also may be an issue of necessity that there may be a need for us to bind, bound together more as
    family simply because it's the only option that we have. If the current generation, my generation is barely able to get off
    Mom and Dad's couch, let alone buy a home, how are we going to send kids through school? Of course, half of us aren't
    having kids, which is a whole other issue. Which brings me back to one more piece. And this is… I don't remember what she
    said that reminded me of this. But this is really pretty stunning in terms of living together in homes and what that
    means and how hypocritical we are as a culture right now. There is, ah, movie out there I've recommended before called
    “The Demographic Bomb”, and I think you get part of it for free online. But in it the interview, this particular
    scientist from China who had done some research which showed quite clearly that the real issue with global warming is everyone
    having their own apartment when they go away. And if we would just have people actually live in family groups of
    four or five instead of all each having an apartment for every single person in New York City, we would cut down on these
    massive amounts of wasted water and electricity and all the stuff that we're using up. So, you know, as they scream,
    the sky is falling on the environment. It's funny how no one's really willing to actually take a step that impacts their
    own individual pursuits. Right, And that's that's back to what we're talking about earlier.

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>Pastor Jonathan Fisk is our guest. We'll take another break as we broadcast live from the Issues,
    Etc, Making the Case Conference from Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Collinsville, Illinois. We're talking about raising Christian
    Children in an age of progressivism. Is it possible that the biggest obstacle facing Christian parents in this goal
    might be the Church herself? We'll talk about that after this.

    in the age of progressivism with Pastor Jonathan Fisk of Worldview Everlasting TV. This is a touchy subject, but you kind of
    stepped into it a few minutes ago.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>And that is me, huh?
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>Is it possible that one of the biggest obstacles parents might find to raising Christian Children
    in an age of progressivism might be found in the Church herself?
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>The the answer to that is yes, but I think you gotta be really careful how you define the church
    and I'm gonna do that. But first, I will give you a present. So I bought this book for you. I thought you could use it. It's called
    “Reasons not to be Lutheran.” It's available on Amazon.com. You can actually read it right now. Just flip through
    it. You can read it right now.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>Let's see. Oh, it's just a bunch of blank pages.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>So I figured you'd appreciate that.</p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>I'll just use it is a note pad. Thank you. very much. I appreciate it.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>Bullet journal. You got to define the church. So when you say that the church is the hindrance, you got to be
    careful because the church has a number of definitions and we certainly don't want to say that the communion of the Saints.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>Absolutely no right, right. That's the solution, not the problem.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>So in there… in that the church being the communion of the saints that as Christians gathered
    around the Word. We recognize that that reality of God calling, gathering, enlightening, sanctifying his Children by His Spirit in that
    Word takes place in real time and space, which involves those people showing up at places and those places, are what we
    now call churches, right? Or sometimes we use the church as a word to describe the big organization that binds all those
    places together. But neither of those things the place, the building, the organization that manages the place, the
    local congregation, nor the the we call ours a Synod, but church body, the grouping of organizations and how they're all
    structure together. None of those things are properly speaking of the Church. They could be for the good of the
    Church but sometimes they can be for the good of the church but is not of the essence of the church can also be for the
    battle, the church, particularly when you say it's for the necessity of the church. And so, with that kind of being the
    context are we in a place where the culture is supported by those organizations we call congregations are not those which
    are going to support you. Doing something as crazy is saying I'm having five Children. They're probably not going to go to
    college in a normal way. Um, and we're inviting them to all live at home, the kind of look that I would get if I were to
    just come out and say it that that plainly… actually, I don't know if I ever would've said it that plainly when I was a
    parish pastor. I probably would've been a little bit afraid to, because I know I would have burned a small bridge with
    somebody who'd just be confused. They just be totally confused by what are you talking about? How can you possibly not
    send your kids to college? You have to go to college to have a good life and how do you begin then to to share with
    them? Well, it's true that there are advantages higher education can provide you toward a career. Absolutely. But it
    may not be true that subjecting my children to sensitivity training and worldview demolition in an environment which they
    don't attend a congregation that preaches for four years straight at the most malleable time of their life. I'm not
    one for that one, right? I'm kind of against that one. So is the church part of the problem? Yes, because the church has
    as much of American or whatever you call it post American culture running its structure and running its decision making
    as it has our theology or our belief system or desire to retain the faith until our Lord returns. Let me give you one
    more example that I know is a super hot button that will make everybody angry. Um, you're supposed to laugh people. Come
    on. Uh uh. There's a big difference between a tactic and a strategy or a principal in a practice, however you want to
    say it. And in theory the tactic is developed in order to make the strategy happen. So let me give you an example of
    each. One strategy, one principle. One thing that can't change is that we need to educate our children in the faith. We
    need to catechize our kids. One tactic for catechizing our children in the faith is Vacation Bible School. In my
    experience, we will die rather than stop Vacation Bible School, educating our kids… eh. And if they happen to come into
    conflict, which one do we pick the tactic. Now, I'm not against the idea of V.B.S. So please don't hear me saying that . I'm
    against the idea of elevating the tactic above even the question, “is it working at what the principal at doing,
    what the principal is? Are our kids staying? And if they're not staying well, then is V.B.S. and Sunday school working?
    And if it's not working, what's wrong?” Those are questions we're not supposed to ask, right? So you have families then
    begin not wanting to send their kids to this stuff, and then they get chided by members of the congregation. I've
    seen this happen not only to myself, but other members of the congregation. “Why aren't your kids in Sunday school?” and
    they can't really say, “Well, I don't trust it, ” right? There was… I'll tell a really nasty story about a friend of mine,
    a compatriot of mine, pastor in the Missouri Synod, the first parish he was called to serve, the Sunday school
    teachers was an atheist. Openly. Didn't go to church but taught Sunday School. I mean, they needed someone to Sunday School
    and she was willing. You cannot not have Sunday School. See, and hopefully that demonstrates, like the divide I'm trying
    to show, right? Can Sunday School be used to teach Children? Yes, but right now our commitment to the outward form is
    far greater than our commitment to what the form is designed to do.
  </p>

  <p class= "speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>Scott asked this, he says, “I was hoping Pastor Fisk could comment on this quote from G.H. Löeber
    in Der Lutheraner”.- That was the old German language version of what has become the Lutheran Witness. - Here's the quote.
    “By all means, it was a chief objective of our immigration that we above all guard our children against unChristian
    schools so the youth studying among us would also be prepared in a Christian manner for their future callings following the
    pattern of the ancient Lutheran churches. As is, unfortunately, not exactly the case with most students taught in
    Germany. We also still have our eyes on the goal and will not give up on it, God willing, so long as we shall live.”
    And Scott asks, “Do Lutherans recognize how much they are capitulating to the culture with regard to Christian schooling?”
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>Oh, not a chance, but that's all of us. I mean, I don't hear me being above this. I am so submersed
    in this culture I know I've got blind spots in my own world. So, but there's just no way that we that we have thought about this
    deeply, not as deeply as some of the pagans. There's a gentleman out there named Seth Godin he's a marvelous entrepreneurial
    thinker. He will challenge you to to ask good questions. That's his main goal, and he's got his side pocket is education
    he's all about education, and he is not against public school. And he comes out and he says it very clearly. I'm not
    against public school, but I'm all for home school because you need both and here's what he means, he says from the
    moment you pick your kid up at 3:30 you have six hours that you need to be schooling them. Because if you don't,
    they won't learn what you want them to learn. Now that guy understands education far better than I would say, just the
    average person in America does, and far better an application than the average human being is honestly able to
    apply. Why do we home school? I'm lazy. I want to not have to do it in my six hours where I'm not at work as hard as I can
    be right. I want to be able to have my wife spend the time with them during the day and getting some of that done so that
    we have an easier task, as it were. So don't see me as saying like home schooling is just more virtuous. You could
    do it. You could do the public homeschool thing where you're doing what he's saying. I think it could be done, but you're
    you're up against a wall in many ways. So now did I answer the question right? What was the actual question?
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>Do we realize how much we've capitulated in Christian schools to the culture?
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>And no, no and to this comes back to the same question I was just asking earlier. That Walther's
    quote there is part of his belief about what the essence of the church is, and if you read his “Church and the Office of the Ministry”
    -CPH has recently released a new edition by President Harrison as the editor- You will find that there are six
    duties of the congregation that Walther says are irrevocable they're duties that we're given no matter what. And it's
    interesting that he puts it in this language because this is pretty strong language. But, he says, one of those duties is to
    start a Christian Day school and have your Children go to it. I didn't learn this seminary. I learned this at Bethany
    Lutheran Church and School, where that was actually built into the Constitution. They formed their constitution around the 6
    duties of the church, I was like that's kind of clever. But so the reason we have the schooling system that we do
    today is because of that belief system. So that wherever you found Lutheran churches he found within schools. If it could
    be done, right? It wasn't like you do it or you're going to hell. It was like, If it can be done, do it. They did it.
    We have this huge system that has arisen that shoves through on a regular basis lots and lots of people. Some of them
    Lutheran, some of them not. And again I ask the question, just in honesty, why aren't they going to church after 18
    or after 12. Where are they? And are we committed to the educating of our Children? Or are we committed to the structure
    that we have? And it's a strength. Don't hear me wrong having this many schools. Why are the Catholics doing so well
    for Pete's sake. It's not like they're doing great, but they're doing better than we are because they still use their
    schools to make Catholics. They may not be good Catholics, but they know that if you leave the Roman Catholic Church
    going to hell, and so they stay and they give money, right. No, I'm not saying that this is really healthy, right,
    but they are at least imparting like kind of their primary doctrine to their people. Are we? And that's not something
    you can necessarily answer on a wide picture. But I think if you're a principal, if you're a teacher, if you're a parent
    at every level, you need to be asking that question. And if you don't have a Lutheran school, what are you gonna do?
    How are you gonna handle the public schools now are teaching transgenderism and kindergarten. Maybe they're not your
    school yet. Give it a year. You know, little time, the bathroom issue all that. I mean, what do you going to do? It's just
    there's no… Don't hear me saying my answers are the right answers. I'm trying to apply tactics based on the strategy.
    I think I have the right strategy, which is Christianity, right? But the tactic how do I actually navigate it with
    this. That's hard. So context does influence that a great deal. Uh, but we gotta be able to get to a point where, as
    structured Christians, we can question our tactics and adjust them as we have need.

    <span>TW: </span>Pastor Jonathan Fisk is our guest. We're broadcasting live from the Issues, Etc. Making the Case
    Conference from Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Collinsville, Illinois, talking about raising Christian Children in an age of
    progressivism. When we come back, we're gonna talk about that technology that we started with. The technology is
    ubiquitous, and it's not going away. How do you deal with it as a Christian parent? Your Children, the technology
    that they're exposed to, the technology that they want and in many cases will need to live as modern citizens.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>Welcome back to Issues, Etc. broadcasting live from the Issues, Etc. Making the Case Conference at
    Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Collinsville, Illinois. We're talking about raising Christian Children in an age of progressivism
    with Pastor Jonathan Fisk of Worldview Everlasting TV. Jonathan, you started out by talking briefly about kind of the
    rapidity of this progress and that it's tied in some ways to the not just to the technology, but to the way that
    information flows and moves now, with the new technology. This is my rose gold iPhone. If I lost it, if I lost I'd
    be more worried than if I lost my dog. I guarantee you. Say I lost the dog, eh, she lived a good life.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>But why the Rose?
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>Because I'm just that kind of guy. But so I need this. You probably have one, too. And at some
    point, your Children and say, Daddy, I need me a rose gold iPhone. I have to have it. Not only do other kids have them, but it is big. It
    has become a tool of everyday life in a lot of ways. I could not do my job as well as I do with this guy texting me or
    sending me email at 6: 15 this morning if I couldn't roll over in bed and answer the email with that thing. So what
    do you do with your kids in this kind of technology?
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>And again, this is where I can give you some tactic, right? More than the strategy. I mean the
    strategy is the fact that you just gave us a strategy. They have to be able to navigate it in order to live in this society unless we're
    going to go be the Amish. If you want to be in a modern economy, it is an information economy, and you need the
    tools of that economy to participate in it. And even as you just talked about the idea of a deployed work that work…
    information work is no longer tied to a place. You guys probably still go to the office every day, but my guess is you treat it
    less like you have to be there for so many hours as there are things that you do there that can only be done there. But
    the work is always and so you need the tool to allow you to work always. How do you start trying to do this with kids?
    Well, we started early with something again we took a ton of flak for which was we didn't show our kids TV until they were
    five. And that's slightly lost a little bit with the youngest who's three now. But not much. Not much, just a little
    bit. And the reason for this was because the media ecologists, those who study these tools and have been doing so
    since well before the Internet basically said, Don't do it. It will slow their brain development. It will teach them to
    not think about what they're watching, give them books, first, get them into books and reading. So they have to have a
    logical thought first, and then they begin to… They can watch the TV and what was so fascinating? I remember the first
    time every one of them the first time we show them A movie. Doesn't matter what movie. In fact we'd pick really nice
    ones. We'd pick like the Sound of Music. We'd pick Fantasia. They are terrified because the evil that they see the
    bad in the movie. The villain is so overwhelming as an idea to them that they're just shaking. They can't even finish it.
    We gotta turn it off, right. And that told me the power of this stuff. It's so powerful. And so how do you teach them
    to not be blind to the influence that's being pushed on them. We didn't let them see TV till they were five. We started
    then, gradually introducing slowly with picked movies. They don't just watch TV. We pick movies that have a certain
    worldview which may or may not entirely coincide with our worldview, but which we will talk about after. So I'm
    working them through the Marvel comic book hero movies because they're about heroes, and I wanna watch them, too. But
    Captain America is a good guy, and I want my son to want to be Captain America. You know, Tony Stark, as bad as he is, has
    moments where he has to self sacrifice. I want my Children to embrace the idea of self sacrifice, so we're careful
    about picking films that will still give something that agrees with us. We're not going to show them just whatever they
    want. We certainly let him run free on the kids' channel because that's full of propaganda. So what about the toys? Well,
    individually, we have never bought a single media toy for them. Their father has an Xbox so Minecraft became a thing
    eventually for them, which, by the way, as a toy and a tool, Minecraft is about as good as you can get because it is
    engineering in a box. It's just really clever. But you know they would. The pieces of technology that Meredith and I
    would have would get passed down to them. So right now there is a old Kindle, and there is an iPad 2 that kind of is
    the kid's version, but they have very strict limitations. They have the main screen on the iPad 2 is where the apps they
    can actually use are, and they're not allowed to go past it. And if we ever catch them, do anything like that they're
    off of it. And those APS are very, very limited drawing programs, things like that. To just get them to be able to and free
    to use the thing. My second child recently realized she had enough money she could buy herself a Kindle Fire. Um and so
    that was an interesting conversation, and she… we let her buy it. But there was a certain amount of trust that she
    had also earned in her behavior, which led me to believe that I could put the child settings on and then also tell her,
    don't go further than this this and this. And she said, Father, I won't and I trust her at this point. She knows
    that the moment she does and I find out it's gone, but… so we're trying to gradually introduce them. So what's on her
    Kindle Fire? Well, this… books, right. The Wizard of Oz entire series. There's a number of kids' books. We don't have the
    Harry Potter series yet, but we're gonna build the library up in those kinds of things that go on there. Things again that
    we think have redeemable elements in them. We'll let them use the technology in a way that accords with their worldview
    and not be ignorant of it. But we're not going to throw them to the wolves by just saying, “Here's the Internet. Have fun,”
    because that's just a recipe for disaster.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-1">
    <span>TW: </span>So finally, let's talk about just two moments in the parenting life with only about a minute here.
    Morning and bed time. What do you do first thing in the morning and last thing before you go to bed with Children? Those crucial moments.
  </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>Because I'm on the radio at 7 a.m. It's a little challenging to do much with them, but we actually
    do it this way because the first hour that I do on KFUO is devotion. It is Scripture and meditation on Scripture. It is mandatory
    that they listen to the radio. Now, the little ones aren't as good at it. They'll run around. But they're supposed to
    sit there. They can draw. They can do whatever they have to, but they have to listen to father teach. They have to
    listen to father teach the Bible. So that's in the morning. In the evening, mother sings psalms and songs and various pieces
    of the liturgy, and she reads to them… depends on what she's reading, it's not always Scripture. We have gone in and
    out of after dinner devotions. It always is… we get it going, and then it falls apart. And then we get it going and then it
    falls apart. And I'm sure you know that story well enough. But those pieces, the meal time is just huge. But somehow
    some way one point in the day, I would even say, just get one. Where you, as head of household first are
    demonstrating, this is what I believe is the most important thing in the world. And then your spouse, if they agree with you on
    this, also find a spot where separate from you as husband. She's doing that as well.
  </p>

    <p class="speaker-1">
      <span>TW: </span>Is it impossible? The person who looks at the world as we described it early in this conversation,
      the mother and the father says, I got my kids, but I'm afraid of raising them in the America I live in right now. What would you
      say to them, pastorally?
    </p>

  <p class="speaker-2">
    <span>JF: </span>Um Well, good. Good for you. Means you're watching. Um, I would say also aside from what? What?
    What do you wanna move? Where is better? Let's figure it out and go. But aside from that… we're all gonna die. Someone's gonna kill
    us. Someone's gonna take it away eventually. And you're a Christian because Jesus is alive. What have you to fear? Now,
    granted my kids fallen away. I can't control that thing, but they're baptized into Christ. The only command I have
    is put the food around their faces. If they don't eat it, it's on them on the last day. But saving them's on God, and
    the promise is what saves them. So put the food of the promise in their faces and keep doing it over and over again and
    recognize that the Word does not return void. I mean, we can't control it. We can't. We cannot make our children be
    faithful. That is impossible. But the promise is the thing that creates the faith which will stand on the last day.
    And so trust the promise. Trust the promise for yourself because you believe in it. Frankly, it's gonna be what the
    thing that makes you confess it. So don't be afraid. Be afraid of what's out there. But then remember, though they take
    our life goods, fame, child, wife of these, all be gone. The battle still is won and the kingdom ours remaineth because
    the valiant one is fighting for you.

    <span>TW: </span>Pastor Jonathan Fisk is host of Worldview Everlasting TV Live, creative consultant to Worldview
    Everlasting TV, and producer of the theological storytelling podcast. Rev Fisk Raw. Author of the book “Broken: Seven Christian Rules
    that every Christian ought to Break as often as Possible.” Jonathan, thank you very much for being our guest. I remember when
    the fear set in for me as a Christian parent and there's not a lot of success stories to tell out of the Wilken
    house in terms of Christian parenting, we were just kind of average. My wife was born to be a mother and wife. She did a
    great job. I just kind of like the proverbial blind squirrel occasionally happened upon a nut. But when the fear set in
    and I realized that this is not a friendly place, whether we're living in 21st Century America beset by progressivism and
    the break neck speed at which we seem to be sending our society and our country into that ham basket of hell. When that
    dawned upon me, I expressed it to somebody I don't know who it was, and they said and it was probably just some wise
    parishioner of mine. They said, you know, you need to remember Pastor Wilken that God loves your kids more than you do.
    He loves them more. He's the one who saw about bringing about their salvation through the water and Word of Holy
    Baptism. He's the one who saw to it that they were given Christian parents and raised in the Christian faith. And
    He's the one who, even if they stray, will remain good to His promises and will remain good to that love that He has for
    them. That's probably the best place to face the world as Christian parents, as we go toward well, wherever society
    is taking us in terms of progress. And that is to remember that in Jesus Christ, for his sake, God loves our kids more
    than we do.

    < p class= "speaker-2" > <span>Jonathan Fisk JF: </span> It’s good to be on.</p >
    <p class="speaker-1" > <span>TW: </span>Let's talk about the nature of this authority that God confers on parents and why it is good. How would you describe it?</p >
    <p class="speaker-2" > <span>JF: </span>Well, I think what you were saying. You really spawned a lot of thought on that with your opening bit there. Because of this tendency to think of authority as being an evil. The nature of authority, I think, is God. They God actually is not just the author of it, but that there is something in His essential God-ness, in His image if I can say it that way, that requires or is authority. And to get at what you were getting at that we don't believe this, that we're in higher rejection of this. There's a common proverb I have, I know I've had it quoted to me before, which is that power corrupts. Which effectively means authority corrupts right. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. But if that is true, if that is ultimately an unalterable truth then that means God must be corruptible or corrupted or even evil in and of Himself. The antidote to this or the flip side of this is the potential that it’s not authority that corrupts or power that corrupts but fallen man, fallen people who corrupt a good thing, which is what we do. That's what sin is. We take good things we make them evil. So in this then, authority is first, an attribute that God has built into creation as reflection of Himself that we see not only in his bestowing upon mankind a dominion, a stewardship over the Earth, but also then within various relationships of mankind, having with the rest of mankind and also even within, you know, animals have a reflection of this. I was just listening to a really terrible book that I didn't finish listening to an audible about. It's called “Sapiens,” and it's about the, you know, the billions of year, millions of year history of humankind. But one of the interesting pieces of it was talking about how chimpanzees develop an alpha male figure within the group whose job it is to take care of everybody that he actually does look out for and will defend everybody else. Will stop fights between lower cast members if you want to call it that. So in this way, authority is also something that if you leave humans along for any amount of time, you're gonna find us siphoning off into various chains of authority. They may not be the ones we've said on paper we're going to do. But they're goingto happen. I've always thought it was kind of funny that we like to say that the voters assembly or the council meeting is a place of equals. But usually it's just the loudest and most willful person who gets their way, and the rest of the group will follow along. So authority is there. We can't deny it. The bigger question is, “What did God intend for it to be their for?”, “who did he give it to officially and then therefore, how might we use that for the benefit of others?” So let me just say one more thing before I toss it back to you, and that is this. That authority is granted to mankind and authority exists from in God… with God's own authority from himself, not for God's own sake. God is not all powerful for God. This is the beauty of who, our God is. He is all powerful for everyone else, even within the hidden mystery of the Trinity unto the other persons of the Trinity. But then down to us, His authority is for our sake. And so when he grants authority to us, when he gives Adam dominion over the earth. When he gives woman to be subjected to her husband. When both of them husband and wife are given a child. The authority is always for the good of the one beneath. It's actually more blessed to well to give than to receive. I believe is one of the ways we say that.</p >
    <p class="speaker-1" > <span>TW: </span>So, uh, you want to put the emphasis on this being this authority being good and not a necessary evil cause one might still argue, “Well, ah, authority just exists because of the fall or something like that.” Is their authority before the fall between Adam and Eve? And then, obviously the rhetorical or the kind of hypothetical question, “had they not sinned” that authority with their Children. Talk about that.</p >
    <p class="speaker-2" > <span>JF: </span>Yeah, that's a really good question. We just had a little bit of that discussion at a conference this past weekend at Pastor Wolfmueller’s church. I heard him in the opening segment there, and the topic was the Three Estates. This idea from later in Luther's life that you have not only the civil government that you see, not only the church that you see, but then also there's other estate, this other hierarchy, the family. And one of the discussions that myself and a couple of the other gentleman were having was. Did this governmental estate exist before the Fall? Or was it, as Luther does imply in his Genesis commentary? Was it more of a result of the Fall? Now the reason I kind of I found myself alone initially arguing, “Yes, it existed before the Fall,” this is what the dominion given to Adam was was care for creation and of course, when they had other human beings, there would be an organization and a natural and a perfect, wonderful organization amongst the polis, the city, that they would form under God's design. But I've also heard it argued that women's ordination is only wrong because of the Fall. But that you know, if it weren't for Eve having eaten the fruit and tempted Adam as it were, then God wouldn't have put this punishment upon her of not letting her be, say, a pastor or being under the headship of man. Which I don't think fits with Scripture anywhere. Quite the opposite, that they are given in Genesis Chapter two before the Fall, they are given a very clear gift, and it's twofold. First is dominion over the world, right, and second is fruitfulness and multiplication. Now what you see in that gift, you see reflected in the things that are cursed after they fall. Dominion over the world and bearing fruit. That is what we would just call family, having a family right. The things that are cursed after the Fall, the eoman gets her’s first. She is cursed in increased pain in childbearing. Anybody who's had a kid knows the pain doesn't stop once they come out. In some ways, that's just the beginning. You know, the increased pain and relationship with her offspring, and then also she is given to it says we translated very poorly I think, “your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you.” Far more clear or literal translation would be. You'll be jealous of a man and yet he will tyrannize you, right? So you see this dominion that Adam had over his woman, even getting to name her as woman as he did. This dominion is now ruined and becomes not just rule anymore, which we still here is a bad word because we're Americans but becomes instead the use of that rule for himself. And so I think the case can be made very, very clearly that authority definitely is built into creation. This is why Adam has woman made from his side. The two are one flesh, he says. “She's flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone.” And Paul makes this argument pretty clearly in Corinthians as well that neither are without each other, but clearly the order of this creation man to a woman is one that creates a polis, creates a city, and that city first and foremost is a family and this is a good thing until we decide to start using… well, everything for ourselves.</p >
    <p class="speaker-1" > <span>TW: </span>Then we kind of left off last time, hinting at what we would discuss today in terms of the abdication of parental authority, kind of rewind a little bit and run us up to that. And what are we talking about? What does it look like when parents abdicate their God given authority?</p >
    <p class="speaker-2" > <span>JF: </span>I think I told a story last time and I can update it. So I was on. I was in a couple of airports this past weekend for this conference and was on a flight that was really late and what not? And there was a child. Actually, I was on almost each of the flights. I was on two of the three flights I took. There was a child, a young child, probably under 18 months, but not not truly an infant. Not like swaddling in the arms, who at some point and for one of the flights, in fact, for almost the entire one and 1/2 hour flight in the air, screamed.Nonstop in blood curdling… like top of the lungs.And in both of those situations I took a moment and I try not to be a real jerk about this is you look over your shoulder.Well, who is that? Right? But, I took a moment to just kind of look and assess what's going on here and in both situations, what I saw was parents who to some extent were ignoring the child. To another extent, were making eye contact, but only in a way that was sort of maybe offering something. One of the fathers who is alone with the child had a little cup of ice and just kind of kept trying to hold the piece of ice out to the screaming child who very evidently did not want the ice at all. And what struck me about this way, which continues to strike me about this is how regularly we see, and this is just a microcosm of this, a belief on the part of that parent, a good natured so far as you know now there's no ill will in this, a good natured belief on the part of the parent that they don't have any authority over that child. Because what? Because they're too young? Because it would be mean? I don't know what, but I know my wife, who's gentler than I would have done everything she could to shush the child.You know, get up close and just make a noise in their ear because it would distract them at least for a moment, so that everyone could breathe a sigh of relief for just a second.And we both as parents would spend the entire trip if we had to doing everything we can, even not disciplining in the physical sense, but disciplining with our own disappointment in the child, that child.And I can say from experience that there are moments where there's nothing you can do. There are. They do happen. Although they're not as common as it would seem given that, you know, two of my three flights had happened the entire flight long.The children respond to this authority, but we seem to have abdicated it.We seem to believe that it no longer exists, whether it is a shushing or whether it is a little more firm word or statement or frowny face that you give the child.This again is just a picture that from cradle to grave, it would seem, we've abdicated this authority. Although interestingly, this I can't take total credit for this, this was pointed out to me at another event a couple months ago by a father who was just chatting with me about his 2 sons who are high school kids.The father pointed out that most parents today wanna be… Wanna have no authority over their children when they're young and just kind of be their friend. But then once they hit about 12, 14, 16, 21. Once they're supposed to actually be letting them go and letting go of that authority, suddenly now they want to exercise authority and they find, well, they find a war.They find the curse of Eve.You know, the pain in child bearing increases and the family dynamic is just all ruined by our selfishness.So this isn't to say that you can't abuse your authority and drive your kids away that way too, or you can provoke your children, as Paul says.But nonetheless we should not… We must believe that authority built into the family is for the good of the child and to have that happen it should be exercised.It can't be abdicated.</p>

  <p class="speaker-1" > <span>TW: </span>Welcome back to Issues, Etc. I'm Todd Wilken. Pastor Jonathan Fisk is our guest. It's part three of our series on raising Christian Children in an age of progressivism. Today, parenting and the goodness of authority. Pastor Fisk is host of a radio talk show called Sharper Iron, and he's creative consultant to Worldview Everlasting. Jonathan, let's talk a little bit about the Why. See, sometimes I think what you described there before the break of the parents just putting in minimal effort when it comes to their children might just be laziness. But you're saying there's more to it than just, "I'm tired. We're in an airport and I don't want to bother. I'd rather look at my smartphone.” There's a real crisis here in authority.</p >
    <p class="speaker-2" > <span>JF: </span>Yeah, I don't I don't see the parents like doing other things. Their attention is on the child. I don't think, I mean, I'm sure there are lazy parents out there that they're definitely… We all have faults and sometimes it's worse than others, right. But I see their attention on the child. I think they sincerely believe that the best thing for them to do is to endure the wrath of the child on them and to… and in doing this they are effectively changing roles. The child is now the authority, and they are the subject or the servant. You know, there was a joke. I remember hearing once I won't be able to tell it very well about cats and how they more or less would eat us except that they figured out how to make us all serve them food anyway. And so why would you eat your slave if they're gonna feed you every day? And so it if you know cats much, you know, that's kind of how they act, actually. But the idea is, you know, they've figured out how to trick us into doing everything we need. And this is almost the way that again, that parents seem to be subjecting themselves to the whim and the will of their children. You know, I've also seen examples, and it happens to where with us, will be at the store, and one of my kids really want something. And even though they know we don't generally buy them anything when we're out just getting groceries, you know, they ask anyway. And it's a piece of clothing. The next thing you know, you're in a little bit of a debate. Well, I've seen parents in public places lose that debate, and I have no idea how they have the credit card. I got no idea how they lose. I mean, I'm never happy about the debate is not a lot of fun. But I don't lose it because partially because here I am a cheapskate. But partially because I also know the child has to be raised to know that money is a real thing and that the binge purchasing isn't ever going to satisfy you. And I often will get to things you don't want and that. And you gotta learn how to manager your finances and be able to delay gratification. All of those things are part of helping the child… or saying no to the child at that moment. And so yeah, it is. It's a crisis. One of my great fears personally, and this is very selfish of me is what happens when a generation of narcissists, a full blown narcissists, are put in charge of the country when they don't believe authority exists in any really healthy way. All that remains is then, when you do have it, and you are that screaming child who's been used to getting what they want since they were two. Never has heard the word “No" before. Well, of course, you're gonna think that whatever power you do have is for your own good. Not for the good of those you're there to serve. My fears will see a breakdown in society. We'll be a society that cannot stand on its own two feet anymore because we don't have any concept of duty. If we want to have an idea of what duty is, then we've gotta have authority because the two things, I think, go hand in hand.</p >
      <p class="speaker-1" > <span>TW: </span>Then let's talk a little bit about the, uh when the authority is abdicated. What effect does that have? We know what effect it has on the parents. They just gonna walk around not quite sure what they're really there for, it sounds like. What effect does it have on the children?</p >
        <p class="speaker-2" > <span>JF: </span>Well, it feeds their sin if I can say it that way, you know, in our day and age. Yes. They're sinful. They're broken, they're self-centered. And all that we do is reaffirm that. I think we talked about this last time with postmodernism being this hyper belief in the power of the will that Nietzsche set up for us or at least pointed out for us that this was where we were going. And in that it's just a matter of original sin being given the a-okay, attaboy, keep it up. As opposed to many most other world views in the world. Communal worldviews. Even Pagan ones communal worldviews. Still, they knocked down the individual in order to create an organization of at least mutually assured beneficial selfishness, right? So we're going to serve each other because we have to because if we don't, we're going to die. Now we're just sort of saying, you know, again, attaboy, to sin itself. And in this again, when I use the word narcissism, I don't take that word lightly. I know it does get thrown around a bit lightly today, but that's a very real diagnosable psychological condition with a scale the same way that say various levels of scale that you can. You're on this sliding motion, right? So you can… You can be a five on the narcissist scale. That's not a good thing. If even if you're five, you could be down at the three that's probably more healthy. You know, if you're up in the eight or the nine now you're in the criminal range. In fact, the book "The Narcissism Epidemic" by Jean Twenge points this out. Among a number of other things that the place where people have the greatest self-esteem in the whole world is prison. If you want to test some seriously, they all think they're doing fine and they got no problems, nothing to change at least at a higher level. So when you get up into that 8-9 range you end up being so full of yourself that you can't even empathize with other human beings, you can't even see how your actions are hurting other people. Similar. And I This is the word I was looking for earlier. Borderline personality is actually worse, but there's a scale again for this. So what we have seen in the book "Narcissism Epidemic" points out, is that the 40, 30, 20 year-old generation has inched up on that scale as a whole, that we've moved slightly to the to the wrong side of North as a group that all of us are testing a little higher as narcissists. And this, probably at least the book says, has something to do with the way we were raised. That that we were never really, to say it kind of crassly, put in our place and that we're basically my fear now, is we're doing the same thing on an amplified level. So we're gonna end up with again a generation of kids who think selfishness is a virtue, right? Follow your dreams. Just think about how long that refrain has been pushed on us as if my will is the only thing that really makes truth. So, two issues here that you have the civil reality of a societal breakdown and I'll fear monger that one a little bit on the left. But then on the right, here's the other thing too. If I'm fine, no matter what I do, and all authority belongs to me just because no one's ever shown me otherwise. How am I ever gonna learn to confess my need for a savior? How am I ever gonna have a conscience that is pierce-able enough, liquid enough, that I can have guilt? And in this how am I ever going to learn of the forgiveness of sins as a real thing? So there's this other side of this where it is very, very directly impactful on the church. You know Paul says this pretty clear that a seared conscience is about the worst thing you can get - the hard heart. And we do this on our own. But how much worse are we going to be at that if we've never had a law from outside of us, which we can believe we've broken. "I would not know what coveting was until God said, you shall not covet." Well, now we don't even know "Honor your father and mother." You know, used to be 9 and 10 were the shoe in. We're down to four, right? What comes next? Murder, right? I mean, we’re already killing babies. Adultery, with cohabitation. No problem. Theft, well free downloads at least. Lies, everyone knows that you don't tell the truth if it's gonna get you in trouble. I mean, golly, that's where we live. How long can any civilization survive without any form of duty? Which, again, is part of this issue.</p >
          <p class="speaker-1" > <span>TW: </span>Pastor Jonathan Fisk is our guest. Part three of our series on raising Christian Children in an age of progressivism. Today we're talking about parenting and the goodness of authority. When we come back, narcissism is both the cause and the result of the parental crisis we are witnessing. Stay tuned.</p >
            <p class="speaker-1" > <span>TW: </span>Welcome back to Issues, Etc. I'm Todd Wilken. Pastor Jonathan Fisk is our guest. Our series on raising Christian Children in an age of progressivism. Today, parenting and the goodness of authority. He's author of the book "Broken - Seven Christian rules that every Christian ought to Break as often as Possible." You can find a link to this book at our website issuesetc.org click listen on demand. Or call Concordia Publishing House and ask for Broken by Pastor Jonathan Fisk. 1803253040 1803253040. A little bit later, we’re gonna be talking about President Trump's policy on transgenders in the military with Travis Webber, a Navy veteran and director of the Center for Religious Liberty for the Family Research Council, based in Washington, D. C. Jonathan before the break, you were talking about this narcissism. But you say it's not only the cause of this kind of crisis of authority in the family, it's also the result of it too. Go into a little more detail.</p >
              <p class="speaker-2" > <span>JF: </span>Yeah, I think it should appear logical on the surface that if because I believe my offspring is so special that I also buy into the idea that he or she should be just pampered. Given everything good, never shown anything negative. That this is the ideal form of parenthood is to serve this child. That this child is also going to believe that they're special over and above everybody else. So one level of narcissism, which thinks highly of self and so thinks highly of offspring, will create an offspring that thinks even more highly of itself than the first. It's kind of a downward spiral. So that self-interest or self-serving, staring in the pond as Narcissist, the Greek figure of tragedy did, staring at his own reflection loving self. Really becomes the only duty that the person internally knows. The only gut duty, right? So if I can just push this in a different direction here, a little bit. Part of worldview or what a worldview is is not only that you think with something, but it's your instinctual reaction. So you think about when you have this gut reactions or these gut feelings. Those don't come out of nowhere. Those come out of what you believe. What you know to be true, and this can be learned from experience. It can be learned from the Word of God. It could be learned from lies. Somebody told you… really doesn’t matter. It's gonna form how you react and how you respond to things. So what happens when your worldview is that you are the only person that matters? Now, your gut, your most driving emotional, passionate will is not gonna be able… not going to be capable of empathizing with others, of having a successful relationship with others. It's going to be your highest known duty to make sure that you come out on top. And that's the terrifying thing about our sin… period. Is that once we have this deep belief fed, it doesn't really ever turn back. Adam wants a finger and he takes the entire arm, as Luther was fond of saying. So remember that we lived in a country that at one point was formed by the worldview of Christianity. It may never have been Christianity, but the Judeo-Christian ethic created a corporate, a communal understanding of the human in which all humans were taught to and rose natively, believing that they owed something to the rest of us. They owed something to society, and even if they weren't Christians, they still… that was part of their worldview… was in their gut. Now there were exceptions to this rule. Narcissists and borderline personality and thieves and robbers all this kind of stuff. But in general the society was built up of people who believe that it was their duty to give something back to that society. And now it would seem that we've adopted a worldview that won't raise that kind of human being anymore. That won't give us these kind of boundaries anymore. It doesn't really matter whether it's this generation or the next one. The path is going to keep spiraling down bit by bit. And it can only continue to increase then the frustration that we see. The inability to have a political dialogue that we see. Or to debate or discuss or even in a healthy way I mean, even fight with each other. I had another pastor friend talking to me about how he goes to an MMA gym. A gymnasium where they have mixed martial arts and he was sharing how it was amazing that there he could be in a wrestling match slash fistfight with somebody who he'd just met because he's traveling and he's going to this gym he's just gone to. Where they're at adrenalized attacks with each other. They roll off afterwards. They roll after it, and they're just… they're buddies. Hey, Yeah, that was great. Thanks for that. All the time. And yet in a congregation we have a little tiny disagreement over the color of the carpet and suddenly we're at war with each other and we kind of ran from that. It is interesting that as Christianity has failed to do its duty within its own house, of helping parents and everyone else to understand duty. You do have young men who especially hunger for boundaries. Seeking it and where did you… where are they finding it. In places like martial arts. Where there's going to be discipline. There’s gonna be structure. There's gonna be an authority. There's no question that there's an authority in that room when you walk in. You're all supposed to bow. Is something that… How can Americans do this? Americans don't bow for anybody. Well, now they have senseis and whatnot. Humanity is going to try to find this authority somewhere. The question is: One - will American civilization survive it, or will it just be replaced by other civilizations that continue to maintain their traditions and their duties? Or/and what about the church in this place ? If we also start to interpret Scripture say, to say that authority is a result of the Fall.Well, then we have no real reason to believe it's a good thing anymore, and we're certainly not going to be making it part of our dutiful worldview.At the very least will be legalists.At the at the best we will be legalistic, nothing more rather than seeing that the Law is good, for its own sake.So the results of this again is just an amplification.When Adam gets a finger, he takes the whole arm.If we're going to raise our children to believe that they are nearly like gods, then that's how they're gonna act. And then, I mean this should be where we go again in the future of this conversation is, maybe we shouldn't be so surprised when at age 16 they won't listen to us at all, and they just want us to buy stuff for them and leave them alone.</p>
                < p class="speaker-1" > <span>TW: </span>How important is that Christian parents have a very sturdy, robust view of original sin when raising their kids?</p >
                  <p class="speaker-2" > <span>JF: </span>Well, you're asking the wrong guy. I mean, I'm a Lutheran pastor. I'm going to say it's kind of about the most important thing with and under the antidote to that understanding of original sin… mercy. I got to say mercy is probably might my chief one that you would understand that what the child does need is grace. But they're only gonna learn that grace if they have a system in which they're confronted with their sin based on real truths, real laws and duties which they break. In this though then, kind of to get more directly at your question. It is certainly helpful when let's just take another example of a place from where it is common wisdom these days to let the child rule. Let's take the kid going to sleep when they're two to five weeks to two months to four months old, letting them sleep, helping them get through the night. Common wisdom these days is that you do everything you can to keep them from crying. And so if you try to put them down and they cry, you have to go fix that. You have to go stop that somehow and this could be done a number of ways. Usually it ends up being food. You go give them a kind of food. It can also be just a little touch. But usually that then leads to a little bit of food if you've got mom involved and whatnot. And so you have a belief then that the kid must have a good reason for crying. Which the child, if they’re a sinner, might not. They might be crying just because they're angry. They might be crying, actually to see if they can get you to come because, well, you do comfort them. But also, it might be a little bit of a game will go a little later in life. And I know Todd, you probably remember this. Every parent has it happen. I'm always still amazed to see how many people will put up with it. Where the, you know, the kid drops the toy off the high chair and you pick up the toy. You say, “You know if you drop it, it's gonna fall." And then they look at you and they hold it out over the side again. They're smiling while they do it, and then they drop the toy again. Now, the second time this happens, do you pick it up again? I never did. I was like nope it's gone. Sorry, dude. And I'm ignoring the child. I'm going back to my food. Then they cry and this is probably going to get me in trouble somewhere. But if they would cry at the dinner table loud enough, what I would do is I would take the high chair and I would turn it around just so it faced the wall. So everyone else at the table still facing the table and the child is now facing the wall. And then we let him cry at the wall. Usually they didn't cry very long. You give it 30 seconds or so and then they look at me and I say, "Well, stop crying I'll turn around," and eventually they stop crying. I turn ‘em back around. The pattern is… Establishing that pattern the same thing again, to bring it back to the evening with the child going to sleep. If you let that… If you assume that the child always has a good motive and never is being selfish in that moment you're at the whim of the child. But if you can also… If you can believe that, maybe the child is just screaming because they're a little infant jerk who thinks that you should do whatever they want whenever they want, regardless of how this affects you, them, or anybody else. Well, then it's a little bit easier when you have to at least, you know, kind of try to get through part of that night. Let him cry for 15 minutes before you go check on him, right? And let him see if they can get their way through it. It's a little easier to do that, especially once you figure out how they're playing me on this one. And if you don't think your infant can play you. Well again, then you don't know original sin. If you know original sin then you better believe it, your infant can play you and your job as a parent is to not get played for their sake, and I can't emphasize this enough. It is for the sake of the child's well being that structure, boundaries, and thereby the authority over to create those is put into place. You, in theory, you wouldn't feed your child candy for breakfast. Maybe people are doing that these days. Why? Because it's good for them to have a healthy breakfast, right? Everything that a parent does is directed in that reality. And the more we know that, the more that is what's driving us, the better we're gonna be at it.</p >
